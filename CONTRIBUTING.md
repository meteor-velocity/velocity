##Reporting a bug?


Checklist for reporting a bug

* [ ] Reproducible bug with a repro 

If you can't do the reporoducible repo, then please be sure to do the following:

* [ ] Attached output of `VELOCITY_DEBUG=1 meteor`
* [ ] Attached content of `.meteor/versions` 
* [ ] Attached content of `.meteor/packages` file attached


###Reproducible bug with a repro
Please be sure you can reproduce the bug. We LOVE a reproducible repository that we can download and see the error happening. Often you'll find that creating a new repo and just narrowing down the error will highlight if the bug is with your code or in Velocity / frameworks.


## About
Velocity is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in.

If you want to submit a patch, please fork the repo and follow the [Git Flow workflow](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/)

Please join our discussions at the [velocity-core google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/velocity-core).

Thanks!

The Velocity Team
